## Market Analysis Function

The `MarketAnalysis()` function is responsible for determining the market condition and executing trades based on the trending or ranging market strategy. It performs the market analysis and checks for the conditions of trending and ranging markets. If the market is trending, it executes trades based on the trending market strategy. If the market is ranging, it executes trades based on the ranging market strategy.

## Trading Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main trading function. It calls the `MarketAnalysis()` function to perform market analysis and execute trades.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It cleans up and deinitializes the expert advisor by calling the `Deinit()` function for each instance.

## Entry Point Function

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the expert advisor. It initializes the expert advisor by calling the `OnInit()` function. Then, it starts trading by calling the `OnTick()` function in a loop until the expert advisor is stopped. Finally, it deinitializes the expert advisor by calling the `OnDeinit()` function.
